Strophe Sample App
==================

A nice consequence of [our work on LibGit2](https://github.com/light-tech/LibGit2-On-iOS) is that we can use the various libraries built there for other C-based libs that depend on them.
In this example, we are using OpenSSL built there to make an application with [libstrophe](https://github.com/strophe/libstrophe).
While it is not a good practice, we are adding libstrophe's source code directly to the app this time.
